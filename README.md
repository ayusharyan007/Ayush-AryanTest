Q1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions<br>
Ans- Internet websites typically consist of two main components: the front-end and the back-end. These divisions are responsible for different aspects of the website's functionality and user experience. <br><br>
Front End Development- Front-end development refers to the process of creating and implementing the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application that users directly interact with. It involves writing code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface, design, and functionality of the website.<br>
Following are key components of Front end Development<br>
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used for structuring the content of web pages. HTML provides the basic structure and semantic meaning to the content.
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and format the HTML elements. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of the website.
* JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It enables features like form validations, animations, dynamic content updates, event handling, and more.<br><br>
Back End Development- Back-end development refers to the process of building and maintaining the server-side components of a website or web application. It involves working with databases, server-side programming languages, frameworks, and APIs to handle data storage, processing, and business logic.<br>
Following are key components of Back- End Development<br>
* Server-Side Programming Languages: Back-end development utilizes programming languages such as Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, and Node.js. These languages are responsible for processing requests, managing data, and implementing the business logic of the application.
* Frameworks: Back-end frameworks provide a structured and efficient way to develop web applications. Examples include Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Laravel (PHP), Spring (Java), and Express.js (Node.js). Frameworks offer pre-built components, libraries, and patterns to speed up development, handle routing, manage databases, and implement security.
* Databases: Back-end developers work with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Popular database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. Back-end developers design database schemas, write queries to fetch and update data, and optimize database performance.
* APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs allow different software systems to communicate and exchange data. Back-end developers often create APIs to expose certain functionalities of the application to external services or to enable communication between the front-end and back-end components. APIs can be built using REST (Representational State Transfer) or GraphQL<br>

Q2 - What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.<br>
Ans - In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure and elements of a web page. HTML tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, and the closing tag indicates its end. <br>
Following are some of the tags used in Html<br>
* Heading Tags:
Heading tags define headings or titles on a web page. There are six levels of headings, ranging from h1 to h6, with  h1 being the highest level and h6 the lowest. These tags help structure the content and indicate its hierarchy.
* Paragraph Tags:
Paragraph tags define paragraphs of text on a web page. They are represented by the <p> tag. The content placed between the opening and closing paragraph tags will be displayed as a separate paragraph.
* Link Tags:
Link tags are used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources. The <a> tag (anchor tag) is the most commonly used link tag. It requires an href attribute, which specifies the URL or destination of the link.
* Image Tags:
Image tags display images on a web page. The <img> tag is used for this purpose and requires a src attribute that specifies the image file URL.
* List Tags:
List tags are used to create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists. The ul> tag represents an unordered list, while the ol tag represents an ordered list. List items are defined using the li tag.<br>

Q3 - Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.
Ans - The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used in web development frameworks like React to improve performance and efficiency in updating the user interface (UI) of web applications. It is a representation of the actual DOM in the form of a lightweight copy or abstraction.<br>
Following are steps for proper working procedure of Virtual DOM<br>
<h4>Step 1- </h4> Initial Render:
When a web application is first loaded or a component is mounted, React creates a virtual representation of the UI called the Virtual DOM. This virtual representation is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM but is not directly attached to the browser's rendering engine.<br>
<h4>Step 2- </h4> Virtual DOM Structure:
The Virtual DOM is essentially a tree-like structure consisting of virtual elements or components. Each virtual element represents a component or an HTML element and contains properties such as the element type, attributes, and event handlers. The Virtual DOM is lightweight and can be quickly created and modified.
<h4>Step 3- </h4> Reconciliation:
When there is a change in the state or props of a component, React performs a process called reconciliation. It compares the previous version of the Virtual DOM with the updated version to identify the differences or updates that need to be made.
<h4>Step 4- </h4> Diffing:
During the reconciliation process, React efficiently performs a diffing algorithm to determine the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM. It analyzes the differences between the previous and updated Virtual DOM structures and identifies which elements or components have changed.
<h4>Step 5 -</h4>Update the Real DOM:
Once the differences or patches are identified through diffing, React applies these changes to the real DOM. However, instead of directly manipulating the entire DOM, it updates only the necessary parts of the UI. This targeted update reduces the number of expensive operations such as layout and reflow, resulting in better performance.
<h4>Step 6- </h4> Performance Optimization:
React's Virtual DOM implementation includes additional optimization techniques to further improve performance. For example, React batches multiple updates together and performs them in a single update cycle, minimizing the number of re-renders and DOM manipulations. React also avoids unnecessary updates by skipping the rendering of components that have not changed.
<h4>Step 7- </h4> Re-rendering and Lifecycles:
As the application continues to interact with users and the state or props of components change, React triggers re-renders and updates to the Virtual DOM. It compares the updated Virtual DOM with the previous version, performs diffing, and efficiently updates the real DOM, ensuring that the UI remains synchronized with the application's data and logic.<br><br>
Q5 - Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.<br>
Ans - One popular DBMS (Database Management System) technology is MongoDB. It's NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it well-suited for modern applications with evolving data requirements.<br>
MongoDB allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a way that closely resembles the structure of your application's objects or entities. This makes it easier to represent complex data structures, such as nested arrays or embedded documents, without the need for complex joins or migrations.<br>
MongoDB uses a flexible query language that is similar to JavaScript called the MongoDB Query Language (MQL). MQL allows you to perform complex queries and aggregations, filtering and sorting data based on specific criteria, and even perform geospatial queries for location-based data.<br>
Additionally, MongoDB supports rich indexing capabilities, allowing you to create indexes on fields or combinations of fields to improve query performance. It also provides features like transactions, which ensure atomicity and consistency when performing multiple operations on data.<br>
In summary, MongoDB is a flexible, scalable, and high-performance NoSQL database management system that stores data in document format. It allows for agile development, horizontal scalability, and efficient querying, making it well-suited for modern applications and dynamic data models.
